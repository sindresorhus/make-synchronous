# make-synchronous

> Make an asynchronous function synchronous

**This is the wrong tool for most tasks!** Prefer using async APIs whenever possible.

The benefit of this package over packages like [`deasync`](https://github.com/abbr/deasync) is that this one is not a native Node.js addon (which comes with a lot of problems). Instead, this package executes the given function synchronously in a [`worker thread`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/worker_threads.html).

This package works in Node.js only, not the browser.

## Install

```sh
npm install make-synchronous
```

## Usage

```js
import makeSynchronous from 'make-synchronous';

const fn = makeSynchronous(async number => {
	const {default: delay} = await import('delay');

	await delay(100);

	return number * 2;
});

console.log(fn(2));
//=> 4
```

## API

### makeSynchronous(asyncFunction | string)

Returns a wrapped version of the given async function or a string representation to a async function which executes synchronously. This means no other code will execute (not even async code) until the given async function is done.

The given function is executed in a worker, so you cannot use any variables/imports from outside the scope of the function. You can pass in arguments to the function. To import dependencies, use `await import(â€¦)` in the function body.

It uses the [`MessagePort#postMessage()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#portpostmessagevalue-transferlist) API to transfer arguments, return values, errors between the worker thread and the current process. It supports most values, but not functions and symbols.
